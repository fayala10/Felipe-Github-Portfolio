As the financial world continues to transition and adopt new technologies, I would like to be part of this exciting change and work for a company that understands this so called fourth industrial revolution. Consumers are changing how they interact and the adoption of tecnology must be a top priority for any company's business plan. I would like to work in sales or business development in the LATAM market.
